# Tester Guide

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have access to the test environment.
2. To create the first admin account, navigate to `/register` and sign up. After this, registration will be disabled.

## How to Test
- Log in at `http://localhost:8000` (or provided test URL) with the account you created.
- Test all major features: login, dashboard, user management, customer and task management.
- Only the admin account can add new accounts on this dashboard. There are no staff accounts yet.
- Report any bugs or unexpected behavior to the development team.

## Test Accounts
- Create your own admin account by being the first to register.

## Notes
- If you encounter database or connection errors, notify the dev team.
- For session or cache issues, try clearing browser cache and cookies.
