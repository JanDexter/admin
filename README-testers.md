# Tester Guide

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have access to the test environment and credentials.
2. The default admin account is:
   - Email: `admin@admin.com`
   - Password: `password`

## How to Test
- Log in at `http://localhost:8000` (or provided test URL).
- Test all major features: login, dashboard, user management, customer and task management.
- Only the admin account can add new accounts on this dashboard. There are no staff accounts yet.
- Report any bugs or unexpected behavior to the development team.

## Test Accounts
- Admin: `admin@admin.com` / `password`

## Notes
- If you encounter database or connection errors, notify the dev team.
- For session or cache issues, try clearing browser cache and cookies.
