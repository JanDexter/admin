## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Service Worker Caching Strategy

```javascript
// Cache Layers
coz-workspace-v3  // Core app cache
coz-runtime-v3    // Runtime cache
coz-images-v3     // Image cache
coz-static-v3     // Static assets cache

// Strategies
Images:           Cache First → Network → Placeholder
Static Assets:    Cache First → Network
HTML/Navigation:  Network First → Cache → Offline Page
API Calls:        Network First → Cache (GET only)
Everything Else:  Network First → Runtime Cache
```

### Data Structures in localStorage

**WiFi Credentials:**
```json
{
  "ssid": "COZ-WORKSPACE",
  "username": "user_12345_678901",
  "password": "ABCD1234EFGH",

  "saved_at": "2025-10-30T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Reservation Data:**
```json
{
  "id": 12345,
  "space_name": "Exclusive Space",
  "start_time": "2025-10-30T12:00:00.000Z",
  "end_time": "2025-10-30T14:00:00.000Z",
  "status": "paid",
  "total_price": 200,
  "payment_method": "gcash",

  "expires_at": "2025-10-30T14:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Timer State:**
```json
{
  "reservationId": 12345,
  "startTime": "2025-10-30T12:00:00.000Z",
  "endTime": "2025-10-30T14:00:00.000Z",
